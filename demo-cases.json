    "tldr60": "Supreme Court held that anticipatory bail can't be denied just because the offense is serious. Court ruled this because Article 21 protects personal liberty unless exceptional circumstances exist. This means accused persons have better protection from arrest, but prosecution must show compelling reasons to deny pre-arrest bail.",

      "facts": "Rajesh Kumar applied for anticipatory bail in a corruption case. The High Court denied it saying the offense was serious. Kumar appealed to the Supreme Court arguing his fundamental rights were violated.",

      "holding": "Anticipatory bail cannot be denied merely on the ground that the offense is serious.",
      "reasoning": "The Court emphasized that personal liberty is a fundamental right under Article 21. Denial of anticipatory bail should be based on specific circumstances like tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses, not just the seriousness of the charge.",
      "disposition": "Appeal allowed. High Court directed to reconsider the anticipatory bail application on merits."
